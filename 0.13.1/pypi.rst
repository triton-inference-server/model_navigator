Triton Model Navigator
========================

Welcome to the `Triton Model Navigator`_, an inference toolkit designed
for optimizing and deploying Deep Learning models with a focus on NVIDIA GPUs. The Triton Model Navigator streamlines the
process of moving models and pipelines implemented in `PyTorch`_, `TensorFlow`_, and `ONNX`_ to `TensorRT`_.

The Triton Model Navigator automates several critical steps, including model export, conversion, correctness testing, and
profiling. By providing a single entry point for various supported frameworks, users can efficiently search for the best
deployment option using the per-framework optimize function. The resulting optimized models are ready for deployment on
either `PyTriton`_ or `Triton Inference Server`_.

Install
---------

The Triton Model Navigator can be installed from `pypi.org` by running the following command:

.. code-block:: text

    pip install -U --extra-index-url https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com triton-model-navigator[<extras,>]

Installing with PyTorch extras:

.. code-block:: text

    pip install -U --extra-index-url https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com triton-model-navigator[torch]

Installing with TensorFlow extras:

.. code-block:: text

    pip install -U --extra-index-url https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com triton-model-navigator[tensorflow]

Optimize Stable Diffusion with Inplace
----------------------------------------

The Inplace Optimize allows seamless optimization of models for deployment, such as converting
them to TensorRT, without requiring any changes to the original Python pipelines.

For the Stable Diffusion model, initialize the pipeline and wrap the model components with `nav.Module`:

.. code-block:: python

    import model_navigator as nav
    from transformers.modeling_outputs import BaseModelOutputWithPooling
    from diffusers import DPMSolverMultistepScheduler, StableDiffusionPipeline


    def get_pipeline():
        # Initialize Stable Diffusion pipeline and wrap modules for optimization
        pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1")
        pipe.scheduler = DPMSolverMultistepScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config)
        pipe = pipe.to("cuda")
        pipe.text_encoder = nav.Module(
            pipe.text_encoder,
            name="clip",
            output_mapping=lambda output: BaseModelOutputWithPooling(**output), # Mapping to convert output data to HuggingFace class
        )
        pipe.unet = nav.Module(
            pipe.unet,
            name="unet",
        )
        pipe.vae.decoder = nav.Module(
            pipe.vae.decoder,
            name="vae",
        )

        return pipe

Prepare a simple dataloader:

.. code-block:: python

    # Please mind, the first element in tuple need to be a batch size
    def get_dataloader():
        return [(1, "a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars")]

Execute model optimization:

.. code-block:: python

    pipe = get_pipeline()
    dataloader = get_dataloader()

    nav.optimize(pipe, dataloader)

Once the pipeline has been optimized, you can load explicit the most performant version of the modules executing:

.. code-block:: python

    nav.load_optimized()

After executing this method, when the optimized version of module exists, it will be used in your pipeline execution
directly in Python. The example how to serve Stable Diffusion pipeline through PyTriton can be
found `here`_.

Please read `Error isolation when running Python script`_ when you plan to place code in Python script.

Optimize ResNET and deploy on Triton
--------------------------------------

The Triton Model Navigator also supports an optimization path for deployment on Triton. This path is supported for nn.Module,
keras.Model or ONNX files which inputs are tensors.


To optimize ResNet50 model from TorchHub run the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    import torch
    import model_navigator as nav

    # Optimize Torch model loaded from TorchHub
    resnet50 = torch.hub.load('NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples:torchhub', 'nvidia_resnet50', pretrained=True).eval()

    # Wrap model in nav.Module
    resnet50 = nav.Module(resnet50, name="resnet50")

    # Optimize Torch model loaded from TorchHub
    nav.optimize(resnet50, dataloader=[(1, [torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)])])


Please read `Error isolation when running Python script`_ when you plan to place code in Python script.

Once optimization is done, creating a model store for deployment on Triton is simple as following code:

.. code-block:: python

    import pathlib

    # Generate the model store from optimized model
    resnet50.triton_model_store(
        model_repository_path=pathlib.Path("model_repository"),
    )

Profile any model or callable in Python
-----------------------------------------

The Triton Model Navigator enhances models and pipelines and provides a uniform method for profiling any Python
function, callable, or model. At present, our support is limited strictly to static batch profiling scenarios.

As an example, we will use a simple function that simply sleeps for 50 ms:

.. code-block:: python

    import time


    def custom_fn(input_):
        # wait 50ms
        time.sleep(0.05)
        return input_

Let's provide a dataloader we will use for profiling:

.. code-block:: python

    # Tuple of batch size and data sample
    dataloader = [(1, ["This is example input"])]

Finally, run the profiling of the function with prepared dataloader:

.. code-block:: python

    nav.profile(custom_fn, dataloader)


Error isolation when running Python script
------------------------------------------

**Important**: Please review below section to prevent unexpected issues when running `optimize`.

For better error isolation, some conversions and exports are run in separate child processes using multiprocessing in
the `spawn` mode. This means that everything in a global scope will be run in a child process. You can encounter
unexpected issue when the optimization code is place in Python script and executed as:

.. code-block:: shell

    python optimize.py

To prevent nested optimization, you have to either put the optimize code in:

.. code-block:: python

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # optimization goes here

or

.. code-block:: python

    import multiprocessing as mp
    if mp.current_process().name == "MainProcess":
        # optimization goes here


If none of the above works for you, you can run all optimization in a single process at the cost of error isolation by
setting the following environment variable:

.. code-block:: shell

    NAVIGATOR_USE_MULTIPROCESSING=False
