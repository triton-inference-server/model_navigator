    - tf2onnx: [v1.9.1](https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx/releases/tag/v1.9.1) (support for ONNX opset 14,
      tf 1.15 and 2.5)
    - Other component versions depend on the used framework and Triton Inference Server containers versions.

[//]: <> (keep up to date list of known issues inside docs/known_issue.md and paste it here on major and minor release)

- Known issues and limitations
    - missing support for stateful models (ex. time-series one)
    - missing support for models without batching support
    - no verification of conversion results for conversions: TF -> ONNX, TorchScript -> ONNX
    - possible to define a single profile for TensorRT
    - TensorRT backend acceleration not supported for ONNX Runtime in Triton Inference Server ver. 21.07

## 0.2.0

- comprehensive refactor of command-line API in order to provide more gradual
  pipeline steps execution

    - missing support for models without batching support
    - no verification of conversion results for conversions: TF -> ONNX, TorchScript -> ONNX
    - issues with TorchScript -> ONNX conversion due
      to [issue in PyTorch 1.8](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/53506)
        - affected NVIDIA PyTorch containers: 20.12, 21.02, 21.03
        - workaround: use PyTorch containers newer than 21.03
    - possible to define a single profile for TensorRT

## 0.1.1

- documentation update

## 0.1.0

- Release of main components:
    - Model Converter - converts the model to a set of variants optimized for inference or to be later optimized by
      Triton Inference Server backend.
    - Model Repo Builder - setup Triton Inference Server Model Repository, including its configuration.
    - Model Analyzer - select optimal Triton Inference Server configuration based on models compute and memory
      requirements,
      available computation infrastructure, and model application constraints.
    - Helm Chart Generator - deploy Triton Inference Server and model with optimal configuration to cloud.
