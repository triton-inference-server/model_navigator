Model Navigator could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official Model Navigator docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at [https://github.com/triton-inference-server/model_navigator/issues](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/model_navigator/issues).

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible to make it easier to implement.

## Sign your Work

We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
```
    $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature.
```

This will append the following to your commit message:
```
    Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `Model Navigator` for local development.

1. Fork the `Model Navigator` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

    ```shell
    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/model-navigator.git
    ```

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    ```shell
    $ mkvirtualenv Model Navigator
    $ cd model_navigator/
    $ make install-dev
    ```

4. Create a branch for local development::

    ```shell
    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass linters and the
   tests, including testing other Python versions with tox:

    ```shell
    $ make lint  # will run i.a. flake8 and pytype linters
    $ make test  # will run test with on your current virtualenv
    $ make test-fw  # will run framework tets inside framework container
    ```

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    ```shell
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -s -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

### Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, You should update the docs. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.md.

### Tips

To run a subset of tests:

```shell
$ pytest tests.test_model_navigator
```

## Releasing

As a reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy -
make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in CHANGELOG.md) into the master branch.
Then run:

```shell
$ bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
$ git push
$ git push --tags
```
